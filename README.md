# LEARNING LOG

## What Is Learning Log?
This app helps keeping track of our learning path.

The user can create a topic, and post a comment everytime she/he/they learned something about it.

Every comment is dated, and can be updated.


## Purpose
For personal use / practice.
This app made me practice:
- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Implementation of authentication with Django


## Stack
- Python 3
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap


## Ressources
Python Crash Course book, from NoStarch Press.
(the tuto uses SQLite database, I replaced it with PostgreSQL)


## To Do List
[ ] On home page, when click on Topics AND no user logged in, it raises an exception
[ ] Styling using Bootstrap
